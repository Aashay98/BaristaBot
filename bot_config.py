# Try using different models. The Gemini 2.0 flash model is highly
# capable, great with tools, and has a generous free tier. If you
# try the older 1.5 models, note that the `pro` models are better at
# complex multi-tool cases like this, but the `flash` models are
# faster and have more free quota.
# Check out the features and quota differences here:
